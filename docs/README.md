# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation hub. This collection of guides provides a comprehensive framework for managing projects from inception to completion, ensuring consistent delivery excellence and continuous improvement.

## Project Management Process Summary

**OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative project management approach built on customer-first principles and clear ownership.** Projects progress through five distinct lifecycle phases: **Initiation**, where a Project One-pager defines the problem, success metrics, stakeholders, and initial risks; **Planning**, which breaks approved initiatives into prioritized backlogs with acceptance criteria, estimates, and a Definition of Done; **Execution**, featuring daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, and pull request workflows with automated CI testing; **Release**, governed by a deployment checklist, smoke testing, and rollback plans; and **Close & Retrospective**, where teams capture learnings and actionable improvements. This lifecycle ensures both disciplined delivery and continuous adaptation.

**Three core personas drive project success.** Project Managers coordinate delivery timelines, manage risks and dependencies, facilitate meetings, and maintain transparent status reporting to keep projects on track. Product Managers define what to build by setting the product vision, prioritizing the backlog based on customer value and data, and validating solutions through metrics and research. Developers implement features meeting acceptance criteria, write tests and documentation, participate in code reviews, and help identify technical risks. These roles collaborate closely, with weekly PM-PdM syncs, twice-weekly standups, and monthly stakeholder updates forming the communication backbone.

**Quality and risk management are embedded throughout OctoAcme's processes.** Teams maintain a Risk Register tracking impact, likelihood, mitigation plans, and ownership, with a clear escalation path from team-level triage through PM and Product Lead to Sponsor for business-critical issues. Quality assurance includes unit, integration, and end-to-end smoke tests, security scanning in CI, and manual QA for feature acceptance. Pull requests are kept small (≤400 lines when possible), linked to issues, and require at least one approval before merging. The project board workflow moves work through Backlog, Ready, In Progress, In Review, QA, and Done columns, while velocity tracking, burndown metrics, and dashboards monitor progress toward measurable success criteria.

**This comprehensive framework emphasizes psychological safety, data-informed decisions, and iterative delivery of small, testable increments.** By maintaining living documentation in version-controlled repositories and leveraging tools like GitHub Projects for transparency, OctoAcme creates a scalable, repeatable approach that reduces single-person dependency risk and accelerates onboarding while maintaining delivery excellence.
